The IPv6 address\nspace reduces the need for private addresses and Network Address Translation (NAT) processing\nby border routers at network edges.\n• Implementing basic IPv6 connectivity in the Cisco IOS software consists of assigning IPv6\naddresses to individual router interfaces. The forwarding of IPv6 traffic can be enabled globally,\nand Cisco Express Forwarding switching for IPv6 can also be enabled\n• The primary motivation for IPv6 is the need to meet the demand for globally unique IP\naddresses.\n• Mainly involves to checks the functionality of all waas features to work with v6 addressing\n\nPRODUCT IPv6 Support on WAAS (Wide Area Application Services)\n\nPROJECT CISCO-WAAS Express (WEXP)\n\nMember Technical Staff - Automation & Testing\n\nCisco Systems -\n\nJanuary 2013 to December 2013\n\nDURATION Jan-2013 to December-2013\nTEAM SIZE 21\nROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES\nMember Technical Staff - Automation & Testing\n• Identified the automatable cases from the test plan.\n• Prepared the HLD document for the automatable cases.\n• Automated test cases for various components on the wexp product for the functionality check.\n• Worked on Config_Sync, HTTP, HTTPS, SSL, SMB_AO component automation.\n• Automated around 200+ cases for various components.\n• Performed regression for all the automated cases through ATS framework with aetest script\ntemplate.\n• Reviewed the automated cases developed by team members.\n• Involved in executing all the automated cases for various releases as Phase1, Phase2 (pi19-25)\nand posted results in TIMS tool.\n• Regression Testing\n• Defect filing in CDETS\n\nLANGUAGE TCL Programming, Python\nRELEASES Phase1 &Phase2 (with 535)\nDESCRIPTION\n• Cisco's Wide-Area Application Services (WAAS) Express feature is a key component of the Cisco\nWAAS product portfolio.

WAAS combines Cisco's Wide Area\nFile Services (WAFS-products allow remote office users to access and share files globally at\nLAN speeds over the WAN) with WAN optimization inside of a router, accelerating TCP-based\napplications on a given network.\n• WAAS system consists of a set of devices called wide area application engines (WAEs) that work\ntogether to optimize TCP traffic over your network. When client and server applications attempt\n\n\n\nto communicate with each other, the network intercepts and redirects this traffic to the WAEs so\nthat they can act on behalf of the client application and the destination server.\n• The WAEs examine the traffic and use built-in application policies to determine whether to\noptimize the traffic or allow it to pass through your network un optimized\n• Mainly involves optimizing the various Ao's like HTTP, SSL, HTTPS and functional wise platform\ncheck.\n\nPRODUCT WAAS(Wide Area Application Services)\n\nEDUCATION\n\nB.E in CSE\n\nANNA University\n\n2011\n\nDay Adventist Matric Hr.Sec School\n\n2005 to 2007\n\nSKILLS\n\noptimization (2 years), Python (4 years), router (4 years), TCL (4 years), Testing (4 years)\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nTechnical Skills\nProgramming Languages Python, TCL, Power Query, SQL, Shell Scripting, C#\nConcepts Networking, WAAS (Wan Optimization), WAAS on Router, WAE(Wide Area Engine),\nWCCP Protocol,\nAutomation Framework ATS (Automated Test System), Selenium Testing Framework\nIDE(Integrated Development Environment) Eclipse, Pycharm, Pydev[Plugin for eclipse IDE]\nSoftware\nEclipse CDETS & Rally (Bug Tracking), eARMS (Regression testing), ACME(Versioning),\nTIMS(Reporting), HTMLTestRunner, Power Query(Automation), ARAS PLM(Product Lifecycle\nManagement), AML Studio (adaptive markup language)\n\nOperating Systems Windows XP/10, Linux","annotation":[{"label":["Skills"],"points":[{"start":7880,"end":8485,"text":"Programming Languages Python, TCL, Power Query, SQL, Shell Scripting, C#\nConcepts Networking, WAAS (Wan Optimization), WAAS on Router, WAE(Wide Area Engine),\nWCCP Protocol,\nAutomation Framework ATS (Automated Test System), Selenium Testing Framework\nIDE(Integrated Development Environment) Eclipse, Pycharm, Pydev[Plugin for eclipse IDE]\nSoftware\nEclipse CDETS & Rally (Bug Tracking), eARMS (Regression testing), ACME(Versioning),\nTIMS(Reporting), HTMLTestRunner, Power Query(Automation), ARAS PLM(Product Lifecycle\nManagement), AML Studio (adaptive markup language)\n\nOperating Systems Windows XP/10, Linux"}]},{"label":["Years of Experience"],"points":[{"start":7829,"end":7835,"text":"4 years"}]},{"label":["Years of Experience"],"points":[{"start":7810,"end":7816,"text":"4 years"}]},{"label":["Years of Experience"],"points":[{"start":7795,"end":7801,"text":"4 years"}]},{"label":["Years of Experience"],"points":[{"start":7777,"end":7783,"text":"4 years"}]},{"label":["Skills"],"points":[{"start":7745,"end":7836,"text":"optimization (2 years), Python (4 years), router (4 years), TCL (4 years), Testing (4 years)"}]},{"label":["Graduation Year"],"points":[{"start":7731,"end":7734,"text":"2007"}]},{"label":["College Name"],"points":[{"start":7687,"end":7721,"text":"Day Adventist Matric Hr.Sec School\n"}]},{"label":["Graduation Year"],"points":[{"start":7681,"end":7684,"text":"2011"}]},{"label":["College Name"],"points":[{"start":7664,"end":7679,"text":"ANNA University\n"}]},{"label":["Degree"],"points":[{"start":7652,"end":7661,"text":"B.E in CSE"}]},{"label":["Companies worked at"],"points":[{"start":6598,"end":6610,"text":"Cisco Systems"}]},{"label":["Graduation Year"],"points":[{"start":5659,"end":5662,"text":"2011"}]},{"label":["Companies worked at"],"points":[{"start":5629,"end":5649,"text":"Automation & Testing\n"}]},{"label":["Companies worked at"],"points":[{"start":5560,"end":5572,"text":"Cisco Systems"}]},{"label":["Companies worked at"],"points":[{"start":3651,"end":3671,"text":"Automation & Testing\n"}]},{"label":["Companies worked at"],"points":[{"start":3503,"end":3515,"text":"Cisco Systems"}]},{"label":["Companies worked at"],"points":[{"start":3481,"end":3501,"text":"Automation & Testing\n"}]},{"label":["Companies worked at"],"points":[{"start":1304,"end":1324,"text":"Automation & Testing\n"}]},{"label":["Designation"],"points":[{"start":1288,"end":1300,"text":"Lead Engineer"}]},{"label":["Companies worked at"],"points":[{"start":1174,"end":1186,"text":"Cisco Systems"}]},{"label":["Companies worked at"],"points":[{"start":1152,"end":1172,"text":"Automation & Testing\n"}]},{"label":["Designation"],"points":[{"start":1136,"end":1148,"text":"Lead Engineer"}]},{"label":["Years of Experience"],"points":[{"start":170,"end":176,"text":"4 years"}]},{"label":["Email Address"],"points":[{"start":102,"end":165,"text":"Indeed: indeed.com/r/Yasothai-Jayaramachandran/\nc36e76b64d9f477f"}]},{"label":["Location"],"points":[{"start":64,"end":70,"text":"Chennai"}]},{"label":["Companies worked at"],"points":[{"start":42,"end":62,"text":"Automation & Testing\n"}]},{"label":["Designation"],"points":[{"start":26,"end":38,"text":"Lead Engineer"}]},{"label":["Name"],"points":[{"start":0,"end":24,"text":"Yasothai Jayaramachandran"}]}]}
